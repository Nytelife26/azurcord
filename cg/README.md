# Azurcord Card Game
This is the cardgame component of Azurcord (listed as AC-CG).  
Currently, it is the only component, and also the original stem of the project.  
  
Its purpose is to provide a CCG style game based on Azur Lane within Discord. 
As of the present, it is a module for Red, but will be made independent shortly.
